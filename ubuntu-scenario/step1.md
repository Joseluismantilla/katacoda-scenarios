The CLI will prompt you a few questions in order to create your scenario:

This attribute will determine the name of the folder of your scenario, and the URL to access it, so, should not contain spaces, should be lower case, etc. For example you can check the list of courses located at: [https://joseluismantilla.com/training](https://joseluismantilla.com/training)
